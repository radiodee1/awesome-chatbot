## Virtual Environment

You need to install python3.7 or build it yourself before launching the virtual environment scripts.

Files in this folder:
* `do_make_virtualenv_bash.sh` -- run once to add a few lines to your bash file that will let you run a virtualenv from the terminal easily.
* `do_make_virtualenv_setup.sh` -- run once to add virtualenv to the installed packages
* `do_make_virtualenv_use.sh` -- run every time you want to use your environment. The env name is 'chatbot'
